This may be a more appropriate way to run the retrospective analysis here. This is because recreational catches are unknown - what is ""known"" is the F multiplier which corresponds to the management measures in place compared to F2012 for the recreational fleet. So recreational catches have to be estimated iteratively at every new assessment at the moment. By peeling years of the latest assessment, the F multiplier will not match its expected value anymore, unless recreational catches were estimated again.What is described above would be corrected for if the latest version of SS was used for the assessment, with the F method = 2, and a precise F index on the recreational catches. In this new set up, with a fixed catch value in 2012 and large uncertainty on the catch of the other years, the recreational catches for these other years would be estimated inside the model, and hence at every peel. This set up gave mohn s rho values of 0.137 and -0.113 for SSB and Fbar.What might cause the remaining pattern is the gradual change in selectivity of the fishery due to management regulations that is not captured in the model in its current form?","5/15/2020 6:11 PM",2020

This may be a more appropriate way to run the retrospective analysis here. This is because recreational catches are unknown - what is ""known"" is the F multiplier which corresponds to the management measures in place compared to F2012 for the recreational fleet. So recreational catches have to be estimated iteratively at every new assessment at the moment. By peeling years of the latest assessment, the F multiplier will not match its expected value anymore, unless recreational catches were estimated again.What is described above would be corrected for if the latest version of SS was used for the assessment, with the F method = 2, and a precise F index on the recreational catches. In this new set up, with a fixed catch value in 2012 and large uncertainty on the catch of the other years, the recreational catches for these other years would be estimated inside the model, and hence at every peel. This set up gave mohn s rho values of 0.137 and -0.113 for SSB and Fbar.What might cause the remaining pattern is the gradual change in selectivity of the fishery due to management regulations that is not captured in the model in its current form?","5/15/2020 6:11 PM",2021
